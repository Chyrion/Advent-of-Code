# Advent of Code

Repo of my Advent of Code solutions, done in Python 3. I'm an intermediate level programmer, so the solutions I do may not be very optimal or pretty, but I'm improving on my skills day by day. Just don't expect anything incredibly advanced!

My first official AoC year was 2021, and I've done a limited amount of tasks from each year. Changes with interest and time available. Previously, I had time to do these but didn't necessarily have the interest. But as of Dec 2024, I don't have much time, but I have the interest now...
