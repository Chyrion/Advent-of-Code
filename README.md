# Advent of Code

Repo of my Advent of Code solutions, done in Python 3. I'm a novice-intermediate level programmer, so the solutions I do may not be very optimal or pretty, but I'm improving on my skills day by day. Just don't expect anything incredibly advanced!

My first AoC year is 2021, but I may solve problems from earlier years as well

### Unsolved (2021):

- Day 3, part 2
- Day 8, part 2
- Day 9, part 2
