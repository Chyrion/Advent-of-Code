## Note about day 16

I don't really know if I can count this as a proper solve. I struggled with implementing a solution of my own for quite a while, and I thought I had a decent idea going (see [test.py](./test.py)). However, after struggling with it for a while and the problem literally coming into my dreams (I wish I was kidding), I decided to see other solutions. I originally only intended to use them as a reference and create a way of my own but.. well, you can just compare the [top solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/rhj2hm/comment/hoqvaov/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to mine. There are a few small differences but for the majority it's very similar

I'm not happy that the solutions are similar, and with that, I don't really want to do part 2. I feel that having another copy-paste situation wouldn't be very nice and doesn't feel terribly genuine.

Regardless, I do still see how this benefitted me. I learned more about string slicing, binary conversions with int(n, 2) and recursion, them being quite central for this solution. I'll take them with me and use them in the future :)
