# Advent of Code

Repo of my Advent of Code solutions, done in Python 3. I'm a novice-intermediate level programmer, so the solutions I do may not be very optimal or pretty, but I'm improving on my skills day by day. Just don't expect anything incredibly advanced!

My first AoC year is 2021, but I may solve problems from earlier years as well

### Unsolved (2021):

- Day 1, part 2
- Day 3, part 2
- Day 5
- Day 8, part 2
- Day 9, part 2
- Day 11
- Day 14, part 2 (code for part 1 isn't available because I didn't make a copy before beginning a rewrite for part 2.. which doesn't even work. Thus, no functional code to present)
